# Jerry Ops Reading Notes

## Ops Readings 

I believe that to be able to learn how to code you must first understand what the different tools that you will use are. Understanding how a computer works is important because you will use the computer to learn and input code. 

## Readings #2

**What is a computer** 

**- Take Input**
: Doing things to computer to input information such as using a keyboard, a mouse, microphone, or the camera.

**- Store Information**
: When information is input into the computer it is stored until it is ready to be output.

**- Process the information**
: A processor takes the input information from the memory and using an algorithm(set of commands) it manipulates the data and gets it ready for output.

**- Output the Results**
: The output process is dependent on the type of computer, if it is a computer with a display it is usually on the display.

I watched the following Video to describe what a computer is [What is a computer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCq8-xTH7jA&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-&index=4) 


**Case Study: China's Spy Chip**

1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
   A hardware requires you to be physically there and is sometimes more costlt, rather thana a software attack can be virtually executed and automated.
   
2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?
   Interdection is the main way according to the bloomberg article but  it is when the hardware gets affected in the manufacturing processs. The second way could be firmware exploits, where you do harm to he firmware to eventuallly gang control
   
3. Explain how the hack worked.
   The hacked worked because the chip waas installed at the beginning stages of its production and only by a select number of people by the time they realized what was going on they already had a nimber of devices modified.
4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
   The investigators were able to fall back and find out where the devices came from and cross reference their inventoru to pin point that they had come from specific places.

   I used the case study to get the answers: [China's Spy Chip](https://web.archive.org/web/20190330085155/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies)
