## Ops Reading Opening Statement

**Opening Statement:**
I believe it is important to understand what happens when you boot up a computer because you learn the terms and lingo that is used like BIOS and CMOS. Additionally, you also spend time learning about the process and if you run into issues you are able to resolve them due to the fact that you have an understanding of what is supposed to happen so you can do things to make it happen.

## [Reading](https://github.com/jgramaho3/ops-reading-notes/blob/main/reading1.md?plain=1) What is BIOS Questions: 

1. What is the BIOS?
A: The BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System, is a fundamental component of a computers firmware, with instructions for the system to boot up and initialize hardware components during the startup process. It is an integral part of the motherboard and is stored in a non-volatile memory chip.

2. Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
A: Imagine the booting process like following a recipe to cook a meal:
   1. Powering on the computer, is like plugging in your appliances and turning it on.
   2. BIOS(Basic Input/output system), This is like preheating your oven, the BIOS performs basic checks on hardware components like the oven checking to see if the burner works.
   3. Loading the operating system, is like gathering the ingredients for your dish, the computer finds the instructions(operating system) needed to run everything else.
   4. Device Drivers, these are like the tools you use in your recipe , like whisk or a spatula, they allow the operating system to interact with specific hardware components.
   5. Running Programs, this is the actual cooking part, once everything is prepped you can start making/cooking your dish. 

3. What is the “Power On Self Test”?
A: It happens when you power on the computer, the BIOS performs a self-test to check if the essential hardware components like CPU, RAM, storage drives, and graphics cards are functioning correctly. 

4. What is the CMOS?
A: You access the CMOS Utility by pressing a specific key in the beginning stages of the start up. You access it to make changes to BIOS configuration settings. The interface provides the user with options to edit or modify the hardware configuration settings and save them before you exit CMOS. CMOS stands for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. 

5. What is the CMOS battery?
A: The CMOS battery exists because when you power off the computer the battery powers on the semiconductor chip that is why it is on the motherboard. It is the circular 2032 battery on the motherboard. It is replaceable and responsible for powering on the chip(memory) that store the system time, date, system hardware settings, user preference, and passwords for the computer while it is turned off. 

 I used the following resources to learn about the topic and also answer the questions on the assingment:
