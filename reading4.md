# Jerrys Ops Reading Notes

## Ops Reading Opening Statement 

**statement:**
  Learning how to disassemble and assemble a laptop is beneficial because as you work in the field of coding you will probably want to upgrade your computer in the future. I also think itllhelp you because you will be able to understand how computers work for the purpose of resolving issues that you run into.  

## Reading Class 02: Build A Computer

**[WikiHow - How to Build a PC](https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Computer)**

1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
A:  The best way to determine the answer for that question is base it off of what the computer will be use for. If you are doing things that require the computer to multi task its better to have more cores. "Higher speeds on a computer leads to faster executions of individual instructions." according to a blog I read online called *** CPU Core Count vs Clock Speeds in HPC Workloads***. Computer that accomplish basic instructions like checking email or simulations with single-threaded code usually have 2 or 4 cores.
   
3. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
A:  You can check the socket of the CPU and the motherboard to make sure that they are compatible. You can also check the Onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Multiple RAM slots/high RAM Capacity, and support for graphics cards if necessary(PCIs x16 Slot).
                                                                                                                                          
4. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
A:  When purchasing storage for your coomputer, you must consider how fast you want to access your data, the storage capacity, and if the storage device is compatible with other computers. If you want to access your data at the fastest speed a Solid-state drives(SSD's) is faster Hard disk drive(HDD).
           
5. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
A:   -  The Processor(CPU) is like the brain of a computer, it processes data and follows instructions from websites to follow through and do task. Just like the brain when it instructs your body to do things so it can gather information to accomplish task.
     -  The Motherboard is like the bodys nervous system it helps your brain communicate with different body parts like when you touch or smell something and your hands and nose communicate that inforamtion to your brain so you can determine if you smell food or if you are safe to touch something again.
     -  The RAM is like the brains short term memory, this is the part of the brain that stores information that is readily available and does not have to be stored for the long term. This could be like memorizing your class schedule for a few weeks.
     -  The Storage Drive is like the brains subconscious because it stores all the long term knowledge we have to store like our name, our wishes and fears.
     -  The Power Supply is like the humans heart because the heart pumps blood through your system and creates energy based to accomplish our task.
     -  The Case is like our skin, it protects are inner body parts and it also holds things in place so we can continue accomplishing.
     -  The Graphics Card is like our eyes, we are able to look at something and use our eyes to process the information to our brain so we can continue moving.
     -  The cooling system is like the skins pores it causes your skin to sweat to make it realse heat and helps you rbody cool dow. 
              
I used the following resources to learn about the topic and also answer the questions on the assingment:

## Things I want to know more about 
 - I would like to spend some time understanding how the mother board helps the computer accomplish task.
 - I also want to spend some time knowing the difference between the motherboard and Processor CPU
