## Ops Readings 

I believe that to be able to learn how to code you must first understand what the different tools that you will use are. Understanding how a computer works is important because you will use the computer to learn and input code. 

## Readings #3

**What is a computer** 

**- Take Input**
: Doing things to computer to input information such as using a keyboard, a mouse, microphone, or the camera.

**- Store Information**
: When information is input into the computer it is stored until it is ready to be output.

**- Process the information**
: A processor takes the input information from the memory and using an algorithm(set of commands) it manipulates the data and gets it ready for output.

**- Output the Results**
: The output process is dependent on the type of computer, if it is a computer with a display it is usually on the display.
